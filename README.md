## Installation and Running on local machine
To install the necessary packages after cloning the repository run the following commands: 

1. Install Node and npm for your machine from `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`

2. Then run 

    `npm install`

3. Once the installation is done run 

    `node index.js`

4. Once the server is up and running you can hit the API using a browser or some API testing framework such as postman.

API_Endpoint: `/find_starting_with/starts_with?stringToSearch`

Replace the stringToSearch with an actual string you want to search in the DB.
